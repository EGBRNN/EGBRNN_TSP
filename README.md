This is the content of the experiment in our paper "Explainable Gated Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network for Non-Markov State Estimation" in IEEE trans on Signal Processing, 2024. 

I am unable to provide the code for now as it relates to unpublished works.

I will make available the content related to one-dimensional time series estimation after the other works have been completed.
